Phoebe's C# HTTP Server

## what, why?
up until this point, i've known how HTTP works - but i've just never implemented my own terrible HTTP server.  

## who is this for?
me lol

## will this do anything of value like ever?
nope. this probably will only ever do basic GET requests until i get bored again and implement more.

## warning
i think this goes without saying but don't even attempt to use this for anything serious. it's a fun little project that is NOT MEANT TO BE USEFUL!!! host silly little pages like it's 1999 on it, and that's it.
